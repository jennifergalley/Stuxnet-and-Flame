            <p class="blog-post-meta">November 11, 2015 by Jennifer Garner</p>

            <p>The first time Stuxnet was revealed to have been an American and Israeli effort was in a June 2012 article in the New York Times, written by David Sanger (Sanger, 2012). The account was reportedly based on interviews that took place over the course of a year and a half with American, European, and Israeli officials involved in the program and other experts (Sanger, 2012). The Olympic Games program was highly classified and parts of it were still ongoing, so the informants requested anonymity for obvious reasons (Sanger, 2012). The revelation shocked the world, as it was the first time it had been publicly and definitively revealed that a nation-state had used cyber-attacks against another nation.</p>
            <p>The emergence of Stuxnet, and the revelation that the United States was behind it, caused a paradigm shift in cyberwarfare. According to a 2015 exclusive interview with Edward Snowden on PBS’s Nova Next, Stuxnet was the most sophisticated cyber-attack anyone had ever seen at the time (Bamford, De Chant, & Snowden, 2015). It was the first proof of the devastation cyberwarfare could wreak on a nation, and the United States had opened Pandora’s box (Sanger, 2012). Because we used cyberwarfare as a weapon against another nation, other nations and hackers now felt justified doing the same (Sanger, 2012). We started a trend with the launch of the Stuxnet campaign, which triggered retaliatory action from Iran as they realized they were unprepared to handle cyber threats (Bamford et al., 2015). Nations all over the world are realizing the same and have started building up their cyber capabilities, and a digital arms race has ensued (Sanger, 2012). In the last few years the US and China in particular have been scaling up their cyber capabilities, as pictured below.</p>

            <p>Paletta, Yadron and Valentino-Devries write in their 2015 article in the Wall Street Journal titled “Cyberwar Ignites a New Arms Race” that Stuxnet not only opened the floodgates on using cyberweapons, but it also provoked a direct retaliation from Iran (Paletta, Yadron, & Valentino-Devries, 2015). The Iranians targeted commercial companies of US allies in response to the Stuxnet campaign (Bamford et al., 2015). They planted a wiper virus on computers at a Saudi Arabian oil production company, Saudi Aramco, in 2012, which erased their computers and placed images of burning American flags on the screens (Paletta et al., 2015; Bamford et al., 2015). They also allegedly flooded the websites of various US banks with denial of service attacks in response to Stuxnet (Paletta et al., 2015). In 2012 Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei announced a new Council of Cyberspace to oversee cyber-operations for Iran, with the goal of becoming better defended but also better equipped for offensive attacks (Paletta et al., 2015). More recently, Iran used malware last year to destroy computers at the Las Vegas Sands Corporation, a casino company run by a major critic of the Iranian government (Paletta et al., 2015).</p>
