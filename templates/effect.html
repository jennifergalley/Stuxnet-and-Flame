            <p>The emergence of Stuxnet, and the revelation that the United States was behind it, caused a paradigm shift in cyberwarfare. According to an exclusive interview with Edward Snowden on PBS’s Nova Next, Stuxnet was the most sophisticated cyber-attack anyone had ever seen at the time (Bamford, De Chant, & Snowden, 2015). It was the first proof of the devastation cyberwarfare could wreak on a nation, and the United States had opened Pandora’s box (Sanger, 2012). Because we used cyberwarfare as a weapon against another nation, other nations and hackers now feel justified doing the same (Sanger, 2012). We started a trend with the launch of the Stuxnet campaign, which triggered retaliatory action from Iran as they realized they were unprepared to handle cyber threats (Bamford et al., 2015). Nations all over the world are realizing the same and have started building up their cyber capabilities (Bamford et al., 2015). A digital arms race has ensued (Sanger, 2012).</p>
            <p>Stuxnet not only opened the floodgates on using cyberweapons, but it also provoked a direct retaliation from Iran (Paletta, Yadron, & Valentino-Devries, 2015). The Iranians targeted commercial companies of US allies in response to the Stuxnet campaign (Bamford et al., 2015). They planted a wiper virus on computers at a Saudi Arabian oil production company, Saudi Aramco, in 2012, which erased their computers and placed images of burning American flags on the screens (Paletta et al., 2015; Bamford et al., 2015). They also allegedly flooded the websites of various US banks with denial of service attacks in response to Stuxnet (Paletta et al., 2015). In 2012 Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei announced a new Council of Cyberspace to oversee cyber-operations for Iran, with the goal of becoming better defended but also better equipped for offensive attacks (Paletta et al., 2015). More recently, Iran used malware last year to destroy computers at the Las Vegas Sands Corporation, a casino company run by a major critic of the Iranian government (Paletta et al., 2015).</p>
