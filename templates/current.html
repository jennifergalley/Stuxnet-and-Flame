            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Current State of Cyberwarfare</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">November 11, 2015 by Jennifer Garner</p>

            <p>The current digital arms race extends beyond Iran, who was responding directly to Stuxnet. Recently the United States and China, longtime adversaries, have reached an agreement not to engage in certain types of cyberwarfare against each other (Paletta et al., 2015). Pakistan and India routinely hack into each other’s corporate and government computers; Estonia and Belarus are both trying to counter Russia on the digital battlefield; and Denmark, the Netherlands, France and Argentina have all begun operations to develop offensive cyberweapons (Paletta et al., 2015). At least 29 countries have military or intelligence units devoted to cyberwarfare, and as many as 50 countries have purchased ready-made hacking software for use in domestic and international surveillance (Paletta et al., 2015). More than 60 countries are currently developing cyberweapons (Paletta et al., 2015). According to the National Intelligence Council in their 2012 publication Global Trends 2030: Alternative Worlds, states seek to both defend public and private infrastructure and incorporate cyber-attacks into their arsenals of strategy and weaponry (National Intelligence Council, 2012).</p>
            <p>In 2014 the Netherlands announced its plans to train its own cybersecurity experts through a domestic company, and that this group would be prepared to launch offensive as well as defensive operations (Paletta et al., 2015). In 2013 Denmark’s Defense Ministry began funding $10 million a year to develop defensive and offensive military cyber operations (Paletta et al., 2015). Countries can also just buy hacking software from private companies – the Italian firm Hacking Team has reportedly sold surveillance tools to dozens of countries like Sudan, Egypt, Ethiopia, and even the FBI (Paletta et al., 2015). But it’s not just countries interested in cyberweapons - some of the unfortunate advantages cyberwarfare offers are anonymity and low buy-in cost, making it a favorable strategy by disaffected groups and individuals who wish to sow mayhem (National Intelligence Council, 2012). About 30 hackers in the Palestinian territories, Egypt and Turkey are building cyberweapons to target Egypt, Israel and the US, according to Kaspersky Lab (Paletta et al., 2015).</p>
            <p>Many believe the United States to have the most sophisticated cyber operations. U.S. Cyber Command has nine “Mission Teams” with plans for four more; these teams conduct operations that could result in retaliatory cyber-attacks against other nations (Paletta et al., 2015). The Navy, Army, Air Force and Marines are each building their own separate mission teams with a similar focus on cyber operations (Paletta et al., 2015). Defense Secretary Ash Carter has prioritized the development of cyberweapons, prompting other nations to join the digital arms race (Paletta et al., 2015). Although the cyber arms race may seem alarming, some historians believe the use of cyberweapons will turn out much as air power did in the 20th century – never actually winning wars on its own (National Intelligence Council, 2012).</p>
            <p>The use of cyber-attacks is mostly aimed at gaining or destroying information, tying the issue of cyber conflict to information security. China is famous for phishing, or sending a large number of fake emails to trick employees of corporations and governments into letting the attackers into their network (Paletta et al., 2015). This is how China infiltrated the Office of Personnel Management of the United States, which resulted in the exposure of the records of more than 21 million people during a 2014 and 2015 data breach (Paletta et al., 2015). John Oliver has a rather comedic take on these kinds of attacks, as seen in the video below. Russia has penetrated networks at the Pentagon, State Department and the White House, using emails containing malware, and stolen Obama’s daily schedule and diplomatic correspondences (Paletta et al., 2015). Russia is especially skilled at penetrating networks usually not connected to the Internet by putting viruses onto USB drives that they hope unwitting personnel will then plug into computers on these disconnected classified networks – much like the United States did with Stuxnet (Paletta et al., 2015).</p>

            <p>The US has accused North Korea of initiating a cyber-attack that destroyed computer records at Sony’s film unit in 2014, allegedly in response to the movie “The Interview,” a satire about an assassination plan against Kim Jong Un (Paletta et al., 2015). South Korea has also accused the nation of attempting to hack nuclear reactors, television networks and banks (Paletta et al., 2015). Most countries use surveillance software on domestic enemies and insurgent groups (Paletta et al., 2015). The leak by Edward Snowden about the NSA’s activities revealed that they had implanted malware on thousands of foreign computers for spying and potentially to gain access to industrial controls behind power plants (Paletta et al., 2015). Many forms of malware are designed specifically to steal information, from corporate and government computers and databases alike, and most of the cyber-attacks to date have been attacks of this nature (Paletta et al., 2015).</p>
            <p>Governments have already used cyber-attacks to gain information, erase databases, disable networks and destroy nuclear centrifuges, as in the case of Stuxnet (Paletta et al., 2015). They are looking into the possibilities of using cyberweapons to disable power grids, take down airline networks, block access to the Internet, remove money from bank systems and confuse radar (Paletta et al., 2015). Cyberwarfare is a serious threat, as it levels the playing field between large and small, poor and rich countries – just about anyone with a computer and internet connection can become a potential threat (Paletta et al., 2015). And cyber-attacks can be hard to stop and nearly impossible to trace, given the availability of proxy networks and other cyber countermeasures (Paletta et al., 2015). A former cyber special agent with the FBI pointed out that we know the cyber capabilities of some countries, but with others, we still don’t have a clue (Paletta et al., 2015).</p>
