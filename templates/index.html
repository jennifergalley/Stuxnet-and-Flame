            <p>In recent years the risk of war has moved to a new dimension – cyber. The use of the computer worm Stuxnet in a joint operation between the United States and Israel to target Iran’s nuclear enrichment plant sparked a digital arms race that has swept across the globe. Countries now use cyber-attacks to spy on each other, in conjunction with traditional military attacks, and to target corporations. Cyber is unique among battlefields as it offers a level playing field for nations of all sizes, and it ties together the global issues of governance, information, and conflict. As more and more systems are connected to the online world and the Internet of Things becomes ubiquitous, the potential threat of cyber-attacks will only escalate. Many believe the United States has the most to lose on the cyber battlefield – but we are the ones who turned cyber into a warzone.</p>
            <p>According to an article in the New York Times in 2012 titled “Obama Order Sped Up Wave of Cyberattacks Against Iran” by David Sanger, who was the first to reveal that Stuxnet was orchestrated by the United States, Stuxnet found its beginnings in 2006 under President George W. Bush (Sanger, 2012). Bush wanted to stifle Iran’s nuclear weapons program, but his credibility was damaged after falsely accusing Saddam Hussein of the same in Iraq (Sanger, 2012). It was pretty clear from the excessive number of centrifuges at the Natanz nuclear enrichment plant that Iran was not planning to use the materials simply to fuel its nuclear power plants, as its nuclear fuel already came from Russia (Sanger, 2012). The CIA had been trying for years to sabotage Iran’s nuclear program through infiltrating them with faulty parts and by trying to explode power supplies, but with limited success (Sanger, 2012). The Bush administration decided that cyberwarfare was the best option to deal with Iran to minimize uncertain results and avoid exacerbating conflict in an already unstable region (Sanger, 2012).</p>
            <p>The goal was to gain access to the computer controls at Natanz, pictured below (Sanger, 2012). This would mean circumventing the “air gap” – the fact that Natanz was physically disconnected from the Internet (Sanger, 2012). The idea was that their worm would invade the computers that controlled the centrifuges and cause them to fail (Sanger, 2012). David Kushner, writing for IEEE Spectrum, in his 2013 article “The Real Story of Stuxnet,” writes that a worm is different from a virus, which relies on victims to install it, because a worm can spread on its own over computer networks (Kushner, 2013). The first stage of the attack was a “beacon” that mapped out their operations and sent valuable information to people on the outside (Sanger, 2012). This enabled US officials to see a virtual blueprint of the plant and understand how the computers controlled the centrifuges, valuable intel which was critical to the next step (Sanger, 2012). Many had expected the plan to fail outright, but although President Bush was skeptical, he authorized it (Sanger, 2012). Months later, the beacons successfully returned the data they needed, and the next step began (Sanger, 2012). The NSA and an Israeli unit respected for its cyber skills jointly developed a computer worm to attack the plant from the inside – this was later named Stuxnet by the cyber security community (Sanger, 2012).</p>

            <p>Once they had developed Stuxnet, they needed to test it before unleashing it on Iran (Sanger, 2012). The United States built replicas of Iran’s centrifuges using some that Libyan dictator Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi turned over in 2003 when he surrendered his nuclear weapons program (Sanger, 2012). They created a virtual replica of Natanz, but kept the testing distributed over several national laboratories to keep the mission a secret (Sanger, 2012). These tests were very successful – the worm infiltrated the computers, hid for days or weeks, then sent instructions to speed the centrifuges up or slow them down very quickly so that their parts would self-destruct (Sanger, 2012). Near the end of President Bush’s term, the rubble of one of the centrifuges was displayed on the conference table in the Situation Room as proof of the destruction that Stuxnet could cause (Sanger, 2012). The worm was declared ready to use against the Natanz plant (Sanger, 2012).</p>
            <p>Thumb drives turned out to be crucial to spreading Stuxnet into the control computers in Natanz (Sanger, 2012). Engineers, maintenance workers, and others were used, even without their knowledge, to gain physical access to the plant (Sanger, 2012). As shown in the picture below, Stuxnet targeted Windows machines and networks, repeatedly replicated itself, then sought out the software used for the operation of industrial equipment like centrifuges (Kushner, 2013). The first attacks caused centrifuges to start acting weird in 2008, and the Iranians were extremely confused as to the source of the problem (Sanger, 2012). No two attacks were exactly alike, and since the code could send signals to the control room indicating everything was fine even while the centrifuges spun out of control, the Iranians became very distrustful of their own instruments and assigned people to sit in the plant to watch what happened (Sanger, 2012). But by the time President Bush left office, no actual destruction had been accomplished, and he urged President Obama to preserve Olympic Games (Sanger, 2012).</p>

            <p>Every few weeks President Obama would get updates on the attacks and authorize the next step (Sanger, 2012). But in summer 2010, the worm broke free of Natanz due to a software error that let the worm spread to an engineer’s computer, then replicate itself all over the world once it was connected to the internet (Sanger, 2012). The US team reportedly blamed the Israelis for the bug, and it was decided that the cyber-attacks should continue nonetheless (Sanger, 2012). Within a week, the worm was able to destroy almost 1,000 centrifuges (Sanger, 2012). But Stuxnet was out in the wild – in November 2012, Chevron confirmed that Stuxnet had spread across its machines, and it potentially infected many other computers as well (Sanger, 2012).</p>
            <p>Stuxnet ended up being a 500 kilobyte worm that infected at least 14 industrial sites in Iran, including its original target, Natanz (Kushner, 2013). Officials in the administration give varying accounts of how successful the program was in slowing Iran’s nuclear enrichment, but some estimates place it at delaying their efforts by 18 months to 2 years (Sanger, 2012). Other observations indicate that Iran steadily recovered, giving them enough fuel for five or more nuclear weapons, if that was indeed their aim (Sanger, 2012).</p>
            <p>In June 2010 a Belarusian malware-detection company received a request to figure out why a client’s machines were rebooting repeatedly (Kushner, 2013). The malware was signed by a digital certificate which made it look like it came from a legitimate company (Kushner, 2013). This was significant because automated detection programs could not detect such a threat (Kushner, 2013). This was the first sighting of Stuxnet in the wild by the computer security community. The danger posed by the ability to forge digital certificates was so serious that computer security experts began collaborating over email and on private forums to share their findings (Kushner, 2013). Stuxnet also used a whopping four zero-day exploits, which are software vulnerabilities that haven’t yet been discovered by the computer security community at large (Kushner, 2013). Experts at Kaspersky Lab, a top computer security company based in Moscow, soon determined that Stuxnet was far too sophisticated to have been created by everyday hackers (Kushner, 2013). They estimated that it would have taken a team of ten people two or three years to write it (Kushner, 2013). The sophistication of Stuxnet and the discovery that its target was Siemens software, which controls industrial systems, led to the first suspicions that a computer worm had been engineered as a cyberweapon by one nation-state against another (Kushner, 2013).</p>
            <p>In May 2012, Kaspersky Lab identified another Stuxnet variant, which tied the initial code of Stuxnet to Flame, another malware (Kushner, 2013). Researchers had initially believed the two computer worms were independent of each other, but they realized Flame was a precursor to Stuxnet that had gone undetected (Kushner, 2013). Flame was much larger than Stuxnet, at 20 megabytes total (Kushner, 2013). By capturing and analyzing the information Flame tried to send back to its “home base,” researchers realized that Flame’s main purpose was to spy on people (Kushner, 2013). It could be spread using USB thumb drives and infect computers connected to the same network (Kushner, 2013).</p>
            <p>Flame was also a very sophisticated piece of malware. Its designers went to great lengths to make Flame undetectable by antivirus software, partly by being sneaky with its data transmission; it would send only small amounts of data at once to avoid detection by the system (Kushner, 2013). Flame could also exchange data via Bluetooth, enabling attackers to steal the information from far away using advanced Bluetooth technology (Kushner, 2013). However, the most significant aspect of Flame was how it infected computers in the first place – by utilizing an update to the Windows 7 operating system (Kushner, 2013). This was even more significant than the virus itself; only 10 programmers in the world would have been able to engineer such behavior (Kushner, 2013). It broke world-class encryption, which would take a supercomputer and lots of scientists to achieve (Kushner, 2013). Some of the countries where Flame was found infecting computers are pictured below.</p>

            <p>Viruses weren’t always this malicious, and they certainly weren’t always as sophisticated. In the 1990s malware was typically the product of pranksters and hackers, who wanted to crash your homepage or perform other harmless pranks (Kushner, 2013). Over the next decade, manual detection of viruses gave way to automated systems which could find as many as 250,000 new malwares a day (Kushner, 2013). Banks were primarily the targets of these attacks, and the concept of using cyberwarfare against a nation-state was unheard of (Kushner, 2013). But ever since Stuxnet was discovered, computer security experts have been battling many other weaponized viruses and worms, including Duqu, Flame, and Gauss (Kushner, 2013).</p>
