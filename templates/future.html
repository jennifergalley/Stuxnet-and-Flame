            <h2 class="blog-post-title">The Future of Cyberwarfare</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">November 11, 2015 by Jennifer Garner</p>

            <p>The future implications of Stuxnet and Flame extend beyond the use of computer worms as cyberweapons of one nation state against another (Kushner, 2013). Cybercriminals can copy the source code of advanced worms like Stuxnet and Flame and use them for their own attacks, either by directly reusing specific components which are available online, or through reverse engineering (Kushner, 2013). Furthermore, the pattern of nation states spending millions of dollars on the development of these cyberweapons is a trend that will only increase in the future, according to the CEO of Taia Global, a security firm from Virginia (Kushner, 2013). This means cybercriminals of all shapes and sizes will have plentiful access to highly sophisticated computer worms from which to build their own. Yet these expensive, costly attacks will not even be terribly effective at their original goals: Stuxnet did not achieve its goal of stopping nuclear enrichment in Iran, although it did slow their efforts some (Kushner, 2013).</p> 
            <p>Hence, nations may spend millions of dollars on worms that aren’t very effective at achieving their original purposes, but once they are released into the wild, may be reused and abused by a veritable army of online cybercriminals (Kushner, 2013). Industrial machines are particularly vulnerable, and more and more systems are coming online as connected devices become ubiquitous, leaving many more traditionally offline systems potentially vulnerable (Kushner, 2013). Furthermore, companies are historically slow at adopting updated infrastructure such as operating systems or security practices, which makes them easier to target (Kushner, 2013). There’s been some movement in government to require companies to maintain better practices, but they have so far been considered too costly to implement (Kushner, 2013).
            <p>Obama repeatedly stressed that cyber-attacks should not be overused, as no nation is more vulnerable to cyber-attacks than the United States, which is critically dependent on computer systems (Sanger, 2012). Many experts believe it is only a matter of time until advanced cyber weapons are used against us, with devastating consequences (Sanger, 2012). In October 2012, Defense Secretary Panetta warned that the US was vulnerable to cyber-attacks that could cause massive devastation through derailing trains, poisoning water supplies, or crippling power grids (Kushner, 2013). The technical sector is the backbone of the American economy and it would be devastating if, for example, Wall Street lost connectivity for a couple of days or weeks (Bamford et al., 2015).</p>
            <p>Snowden pointed out that the US has only opened itself up to harm through programs like Olympic Games. By engaging in all-out cyberwarfare ourselves, we have set the trend that other countries – some with even less respect for the rules – will view as an acknowledgement that cyber-attacks are fair game (Bamford et al., 2015). We as a nation have more to lose in the cyber-battlefield because we spend more money on research and development than other countries (Bamford et al., 2015). As a result, we should be the ones preserving the Internet as a free and peaceful environment, because we rely on a safe and interconnected Internet in order to compete; instead we are opening ourselves up to attacks from others (Bamford et al., 2015). Foreign attacks could potentially bring down access to the Internet itself, which for us would be a crippling blow to our economy (Bamford et al., 2015).</p>
            <p>Snowden also had a lot to say about the NSA and the potential consequences of its actions. He claims the National Security Agency has become more like the national hacking or surveillance agency, and that they are no longer making us more secure as a nation but less (Bamford et al., 2015). They have deprioritized defense in favor of offense, and as a result have built backdoors into our critical infrastructure that other nations can use to attack us (Bamford et al., 2015). As a result, he says, we’ve sacrificed our own security for the sake of surveillance, but the reality is that we have so much more to lose than other nations (Bamford et al., 2015). The NSA has also established a pattern of finding and shelving zero-day exploits, so they can be used later or sold to the highest bidder, instead of informing the affected companies and systems so they can fix the problem and make our nation more secure (Bamford et al., 2015). Essentially, we’re creating a class of internet security researchers who find vulnerabilities but then instead of disclosing them, sell them to secret agencies or to criminal groups on the black market, which leaves us much less secure on a broad economic level and creates a black market for digital weapons (Bamford et al., 2015). The NSA has also paid the RSA $10 million to use an insecure encryption standard by default in their products (Bamford et al., 2015). That makes us more vulnerable not only to the surveillance of domestic agencies but also foreign agencies (Bamford et al., 2015).</p>
            <p>Currently in the United States, the Senate is putting forth a bill called CISPA, short for Cyber Intelligence Sharing Between Private Companies and Government Agencies, in which they’re trying to authorize private companies to share information on all of their customers with intelligence agencies, with the understanding that the information will only be used to protect them (Bamford et al., 2015). Congress is also trying to immunize companies in a way that will allow them to invite groups like the NSA or FBI to voluntarily install surveillance devices on their internal networks, with the stated intent being to detect and respond to cyber-attacks as they occur; but in the process immunizing companies from protecting their customers’ privacy (Bamford et al., 2015). These are not only gross attempts at mass surveillance, but they are not likely to be effective even if passed. The reality is that in recent years the majority of terrorist attacks have been disrupted by non-digital means, not through cyber-espionage or mass surveillance; in fact, they missed things like the Boston Marathon bombings and the underwear bomber (Bamford et al., 2015). They might be more effective at responding to purely cyber-attacks, but at what cost?</p>
            <p>What could be coming down the line is automation for these kinds of attacks, where an attack is detected and an automated response is created (Bamford et al., 2015). But it is inherently dangerous to automate an aggressive response to a detected event because of false positives and countermeasures like proxies, which could lead us to attacking the wrong country or system (Bamford et al., 2015). Snowden argues that we should never take humans out of the decision chain in acts that could potentially end human lives or start a war (Bamford et al., 2015). After all, the NSA has previously attacked internet service providers, universities, and hospitals – attacks that could kill people if anything went awry (Bamford et al., 2015). He argues there isn’t anything worth that kind of risk just to place an entire population under mass surveillance, much less a foreign population, where the fallout of accidental casualties would be harrowing (Bamford et al., 2015).</p>
