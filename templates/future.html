            <h2 class="blog-post-title">The Future of Cyberwarfare</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">November 11, 2015 by Jennifer Garner</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, the future implications of Stuxnet and Flame extend beyond the use of computer worms as cyberweapons of one nation state against another (Kushner, 2013). Cybercriminals can copy the source code of advanced worms like Stuxnet and Flame and use them for their own attacks, either by directly reusing specific components which are available online, or through reverse engineering (Kushner, 2013). Furthermore, the pattern of nation states spending millions of dollars on the development of these cyberweapons is a trend that will only continue to increase, according to the CEO of Taia Global, a security firm from Virginia (Kushner, 2013). This means cybercriminals of all shapes and sizes will have plentiful access to highly sophisticated computer worms from which to build their own. Yet these expensive, costly attacks will not even be terribly effective at their original goals: Stuxnet did not achieve its goal of stopping nuclear enrichment in Iran, although it did slow their efforts some (Kushner, 2013).</p> 
            <p>Hence, nations may spend millions of dollars on worms that aren’t very effective at achieving their original purposes, but once they are released into the wild, may be reused and abused by a veritable army of online cybercriminals (Kushner, 2013). Industrial machines are particularly vulnerable, and more and more systems are coming online as connected devices become ubiquitous, leaving many more traditionally offline systems potentially vulnerable (Kushner, 2013). Furthermore, companies are historically slow at adopting updated infrastructure such as operating systems or security practices, which makes them easier to target (Kushner, 2013). There’s been some movement in government to require companies to maintain better practices, but they have so far been considered too costly to implement (Kushner, 2013).</p>
            <p>Obama reportedly stressed that cyber-attacks should not be overused, as no nation is more vulnerable to cyber-attacks than the United States, which is critically dependent on computer systems (Sanger, 2012). Many experts believe it is only a matter of time until advanced cyber weapons are used against us, with devastating consequences (Sanger, 2012). In October 2012, Defense Secretary Panetta warned that the US was vulnerable to cyber-attacks that could cause massive devastation through derailing trains, poisoning water supplies, or crippling power grids (Kushner, 2013). The technical sector is the backbone of the American economy and it would be devastating if, for example, Wall Street lost connectivity for a couple of days or weeks (Bamford et al., 2015).</p>
            <p>Snowden pointed out that the US has only opened itself up to harm through programs like Olympic Games. By engaging in all-out cyberwarfare ourselves, we have set the trend that other countries – some with even less respect for the rules – have viewed as an acknowledgement that cyber-attacks are fair game (Bamford et al., 2015). As Snowden states in the video below, we as a nation have more to lose in the cyber-battlefield because we spend more money on research and development than other countries, and because we rely on the internet so much (Bamford et al., 2015). As a result, we should be the ones preserving the internet as a free and peaceful environment, because we rely on a safe and interconnected internet in order to compete; instead we are opening ourselves up to attacks from others (Bamford et al., 2015). Foreign attacks could potentially bring down our access to the internet itself, which would be a crippling blow to our economy (Bamford et al., 2015).</p>

            <p>Snowden also criticized the NSA and discussed potential consequences of its actions, highlighting the important role that government plays in the cyber plane of conflict. He says the National Security Agency has become more like the national hacking or surveillance agency, and that they are no longer making us more secure as a nation but less (Bamford et al., 2015). They have deprioritized defense in favor of offense, and as a result have built backdoors into our critical infrastructure that other nations can use to attack us (Bamford et al., 2015). As a result, we’ve sacrificed our own security for the sake of surveillance, but the reality is that we have so much more to lose than other nations (Bamford et al., 2015). The NSA has also created a class of internet security researchers who find vulnerabilities like zero-day exploits but then instead of disclosing them so they can be fixed, they sell them to secret agencies or criminal groups on the black market, which leaves us much less secure on a broad economic level and creates a black market for digital weapons (Bamford et al., 2015). They also paid the RSA $10 million to use an insecure encryption standard by default in their products (Bamford et al., 2015). All of this makes us more vulnerable not only to the surveillance of domestic agencies but also foreign agencies (Bamford et al., 2015).</p>
            <p>The recent actions of the NSA stress the importance of good governance in this new era of cyberwarfare. We need to make sure our government, on every level, is prioritizing defensive strategies even more than offensive ones. By prioritizing offense and surveillance and deprioritizing defense, the NSA has not only made the US more vulnerable to attack, but invited more attacks as retaliation. Paradoxically, the NSA recognizes the immense ability to attack and spy on other nations through cyber-attacks, yet ignores the possibility of our own systems being under fire. Someday this will catch up to us – probably sooner rather than later. The government is necessarily always involved in matters of conflict – and right now, they’ve put us on track to lose.</p>
            <p>The issue of conflict through cyberwarfare is also closely tied to information and information privacy. Currently in the United States, the Senate is putting forth a bill called CISPA, short for Cyber Intelligence Sharing Between Private Companies and Government Agencies, in which they’re trying to authorize private companies to share information on all of their customers with intelligence agencies, with the understanding that the information will only be used to protect them (Bamford et al., 2015). Congress is also trying to immunize companies in a way that will allow them to invite groups like the NSA or FBI to voluntarily install surveillance devices on their internal networks, with the stated intent being to detect and respond to cyber-attacks as they occur; but in the process immunizing companies from protecting their customers’ privacy (Bamford et al., 2015). These are not only gross attempts at mass surveillance, but they are not likely to be effective even if passed. The reality is that in recent years the majority of terrorist attacks have been disrupted by non-digital means, not through cyber-espionage or mass surveillance; in fact, they missed things like the Boston Marathon bombings and the underwear bomber (Bamford et al., 2015). They might be more effective at responding to pure cyber-attacks, but at what cost?</p>
            <p>The use of cyber-attacks primarily to steal and destroy information and the recent attempts at truly mass surveillance by organizations like the NSA and others throw information and information privacy right into the fray of cyberwarfare. Unless companies, government agencies, and nations come together to rally for information security and consumer privacy, these phrases will become a thing of the past. Recently efforts on the part of companies like Google and Microsoft have fought back against government demands for free access to customer information, but it’s unclear how this battle will play out in the coming years, let alone decades. And as the NSA gains more and more traction in unlimited advanced surveillance, there may be nothing that anyone can do to stop them.</p>
            <p>Finally, another potential future aspect of cyberwarfare is automation for cyber-attacks. An attack might be detected and an automated response created to handle the threat (Bamford et al., 2015). But it is inherently dangerous to automate an aggressive response to a detected event because of false positives and countermeasures like proxies, which could lead us to attacking the wrong country or system (Bamford et al., 2015). Snowden argues that we should never take humans out of the decision chain in acts that could potentially end human lives or start a war (Bamford et al., 2015). After all, the NSA has previously attacked internet service providers, universities, and hospitals – attacks that could kill people if anything went awry (Bamford et al., 2015). He argues that there isn’t anything worth that kind of risk just to place an entire population under mass surveillance, much less a foreign population, where the fallout of accidental casualties would be harrowing (Bamford et al., 2015).</p> 
            <p>Stuxnet was the gunshot that started the race to have the most sophisticated cyber capabilities all around the world. Cyber-attacks have been used by governments mostly for surveillance and spying, such as the Flame virus developed by the United States government. However, the potential for future destruction is alarming and escalating, especially in the United States where the cyber world is so integral to our everyday operation. Edward Snowden offers critiques of the NSA, whose priority on surveillance and offense has left the United States even more vulnerable to foreign attacks. The sanctity of the privacy of customer information and the caution and restraint in who we decide to attack are two pillars of cyber integrity that are also imminently under threat. There is no doubt that cyber is the most important battlefield to safeguard in the coming years, given the potential for wholesale destruction – and the United States may have started a war that it is doomed to lose.</p>
